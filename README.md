## **Quadruplexes and G4-iM Grinder**

<details>

<summary>What are quadruplexes?</summary>

**[G-quadruplexes (G4s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-quadruplex):**  
G4s are DNA or RNA sequences rich in guanine, where four guanine bases can associate through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding to form a square planar structure called a guanine tetrad (G-tetrad or G-quartet). Two or more G-tetrads can then stack on top of each other to form a stable G4. Unimolecular G4s occur naturally in telomeric regions and various transcriptional regulatory regions.

**[C-quadruplexes or i-Motifs (iM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-motif_DNA):**  
iMs are quadruplex structures formed by cytosine-rich DNA or RNA, analogous to G4s formed by guanine-rich sequences. C-rich DNA regions frequently appear in gene-regulatory portions of the genome. iMs have been experimentally observed in human cells and may play roles in cell reproduction. They also have potential applications in nanotechnology due to their pH sensitivity, serving as biosensors, nanomachines, and molecular switches.

<details>

<summary>Searching for quadruplexes?</summary>

Quadruplexes have drawn significant attention in recent years due to evidence of their functional roles across many living organisms, yet their precise formation mechanisms remain under investigation. To pinpoint potential structures, \emph{in silico} predictions rely on known \emph{in vitro} paradigms. Loops, tetrad count, run imperfections, and flanking genomic regions all appear to influence quadruplex topology and dynamics.

**G4-iM Grinder (GiG)** provides:  
1. A **search engine** that locates all possible candidates matching user-defined criteria (G-runs, C-runs, loops, etc.).  
2. A **qualification engine** that ranks or filters results by their probability of forming an actual quadruplex or i-Motif, their frequency in the genome, their overlap with known quadruplex sequences, and more.

</details>

### **Important Terms & Abbreviations**

1. **Quadruplex**: A genomic sequence that forms a G4 or iM.  
2. **G4**: A sequence confirmed to form a G4 \emph{in vitro}.  
3. **iM**: A sequence confirmed to form an iM \emph{in vitro}.  
4. **PQS**: A \emph{Potential} G4 Sequence detected \emph{in silico} but not yet confirmed \emph{in vitro}.  
5. **PiMS**: A \emph{Potential} iM Sequence detected \emph{in silico} but not yet confirmed \emph{in vitro}.

  count <- 0
  for( i in x ){
    if( ! require( i , character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE ) ){
      Info <- paste0(Info, i, " ")
      count <- count +1
    }
  }
  if(count == 0){
    print("Package dependencies PASSED.")
  } else {
    print(Info)
  }
  AAA <- R.version
  if(as.numeric(AAA$major) == 4){
    if(as.numeric(AAA$minor) >= 0){
      print("R version PASSED (>= 4.0)")
    } else {
      print("R version FAILED. Update R to >= 4.0")
    }
  } else {
    print("R version FAILED. Update R to >= 4.0")
  }
}

FailFoo(pck)
```

Expected result:

```
[1] "Package dependencies PASSED."
[1] "R version PASSED (>= 4.0)"
```

*(Additional PQSfinder parameters may be modified as needed.)*
</details>

<details>
<summary>G. Summarizing G4-iM Grinder results</summary>

Use `GiGList.Analysis` to consolidate results. For example:

```r
ResultTable <- GiGList.Analysis(GiGList = Rs, iden = "Predefined")
ResultTable[2, ] <- GiGList.Analysis(GiGList = Rs2, iden = "ForceLimit")
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>I. Potential Higher-Order Analysis</summary>

Method 3A (M3A) detects Potential Higher-Order Quadruplex Sequences (PHOQS). Use `GiG.M3Structure` to identify sub-unit conformations:

```r
N <- as.numeric(rownames(Rs$PQSM3a[Rs$PQSM3a$Length == max(Rs$PQSM3a$Length), ][1]))

Longest_PHOQS <- GiG.M3Structure(
  GiGList = Rs,
  M3ACandidate = N,
  MAXite = 10000
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>L. Searching for i-Motifs</summary>

Setting `RunComposition = "C"` targets i-Motif sequences:

```r
Rs_iM1 <- G4iMGrinder(
  Name = "LmajorESTs",
  Sequence = Sequence,
  RunComposition = "C"
)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>M. Notes on the search engine</summary>

**G4-iM Grinder** locates overlapping or nested results that match user-defined parameters. For instance, a sequence with multiple short G-runs can generate several possible PQS overlapping one another. By default, perfect runs (e.g., `GGG`) are prioritized over slightly imperfect runs (e.g., `GCGG`) to maintain performance and to highlight the sequences most likely to form stable quadruplexes.
